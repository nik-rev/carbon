Hi! I love contributing to open source and programming in Rust. It is my _favorite_ language and I love how productive I am with it.

I am working on [ferrishot](ferrishot.com), a powerful cross-platform screenshot app! ![GitHub Repo stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/nik-rev/ferrishot)

Open source contributions I am most proud of:

- Helix
  - [Inline git blame](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/pull/13133)
  - [Color swatches, show indicator to colors like in CSS: ðŸŸ© green ðŸŸ¥ #ffaaaa](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/pull/12308)
  - [File explorer operations](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/pull/12902)
