Hi! I love contributing to open source and programming in Rust. It is my _favorite_ language and I love how productive I am with it.

One of the open source projects I'm working on is [ferrishot](https://github.com/nik-rev/ferrishot), a cross-platform screenshot app written in Rust.

Some of the open source contributions I am most proud of:

- [Inline git blame for the Helix editor](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/pull/13133)
- [Color swatches ( ðŸŸ© green ðŸŸ¥ #ffaaaa )](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/pull/12308)
- [Improving Helix's File Explorer](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/pull/12902)
