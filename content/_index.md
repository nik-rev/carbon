I love open source software and programming in Rust :)

My software:

- [ferrishot](https://ferrishot.com), a powerful cross-platform screenshot app[![ferrishot GitHub Repo stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/nik-rev/ferrishot)](https://github.com/nik-rev/ferrishot)
- [countryfetch](https://github.com/nik-rev/countryfetch) is a command line app which displays your country's flag in beautiful ASCII art [![countryfetch GitHub Repo stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/nik-rev/countryfetch)](https://github.com/nik-rev/countryfetch)
