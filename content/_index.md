I love open source software and programming in Rust :)

Favorite things I've built:

- [ferrishot](https://ferrishot.com), a powerful cross-platform screenshot app[![ferrishot GitHub Repo stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/nik-rev/ferrishot)](https://github.com/nik-rev/ferrishot)

Open source contributions I am most proud of:

- Helix

  - [Color swatches](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/pull/12308)
