# Pull requests I'm proud of

In my free time I like to contribute to open source software which I use and see ways it can improve. Specificaly the most happy about the following ones:

- [Color swatches ( ðŸŸ© green ðŸŸ¥ #ffaaaa ) #12308](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/pull/12308)
- [Colors for items in the completion menu #12299](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/pull/12299)
- [Colors for directory prompt completions #12205](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/pull/12205)

# Patchy

[https://github.com/NikitaRevenco/patchy](https://github.com/NikitaRevenco/patchy)

I built a command line tool that makes it easy to declaratively configure personal forks of repositories.

Say I want to use the Helix editor but also use features from certain pull requests like `#12309`, `#12285`, `#8908` and `#11164`.

I want to keep my branch and those merged PRs up to date aswell, easily add and remove pull requests.

With patchy, doing that is really easy with this config:

```toml
repo = "helix-editor/helix"
remote-branch = "master"
local-branch = "patchy"
pull-requests = [
  "12309",
  "11285",
  "8908",
  "11164"
]
```

Then just running a single command:

```sh
patchy run
```

# Semantic Blockquotes Plugin

[https://github.com/NikitaRevenco/rehype-semantic-blockquotes](https://github.com/NikitaRevenco/rehype-semantic-blockquotes)

There is a certain correct way to `@mention` an author of a quote when using the `<blockquote>` HTML element. Unfortunately, it involves quite a lot of boilerplate and a lot of people don't know about it.

That's why I created `rehype-semantic-blockquotes`, which operates on the HTML syntax tree to transform the following markdown:

```md
> We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them.
>
> @ Albert Einstein
```

Into the following HTML:

```html
<figure data-blockquote-container="">
  <blockquote data-blockquote-content="">
    <p>
      We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we
      created them.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <figcaption data-blockquote-credit="">
    <p>Albert Einstein</p>
  </figcaption>
</figure>
```
