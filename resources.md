- [Compehending Proc Macros](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMCRQj9Hbx8)

  Nicely goes in-depth about how to create procedural macros in Rust using the `syn` and `quote` crates.

  Goes into detailed type design of the problem, slowly building up to a solution to a procedural macro which parses python list comprehensions.

- [Visualizing memory layout of Rust's data types](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_o-YRxf_cc)

  This video was a really nice summary of how Rust represents the memory layouts of various primitive data types.

  It also goes in-depth on the Fn, FnOnce and FnMut traits, which I haven't really had a thorough understanding of until I watched it.
