    <p>10 months ago I tried Linux for the first time. First it was Ubuntu, then I switched to Debian, then Arch Linux.</p>
<p>I tested them all for a few months and was mostly happy with my Arch Linux for about 6 months. But then I tried NixOS&hellip;</p>
<h2 class="heading" id="first-encounter-with-nixos">
  First Encounter with NixOS
  <a href="#first-encounter-with-nixos">#</a>
</h2>
<p>That was until 1 week ago where I decided &ldquo;everyone seems to be talking about nix, idk what that is, I won&rsquo;t do any research, just going to boot it on my computer and see what happens&rdquo;</p>
<p>For about a whole day I was transferring my <a href="https://github.com/nikitarevenco/dotfiles">dotfiles configuration</a> to NixOS. First I started doing it the primordial way, with configuration.nix and zero flakes.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="initial-resistance-to-flakes">
  Initial Resistance to Flakes
  <a href="#initial-resistance-to-flakes">#</a>
</h3>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t want to use flakes because I didn&rsquo;t see a point, I just saw it as extra added complexity. After a few days I was really done tinkering with my setup and things worked fine now.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="a-comparison-to-arch-linux">
  A Comparison to Arch Linux
  <a href="#a-comparison-to-arch-linux">#</a>
</h3>
<p>My other laptop had arch on it, and after an update I couldn&rsquo;t boot into my system, so I decided to try install NixOS on it, again</p>
<p>Wow, the entire installation literally took about 10 minutes. I didn&rsquo;t have to follow the Arch wiki for the 10th time then running a bunch of symlink commands and editing random /etc files and running random commands to get my system working.</p>
<p>It was just as simple as git clone, <code>sudo nixos-rebuild switch</code>. I&rsquo;m impressed, seriously impressed.</p>
<h2 class="heading" id="switching-to-helix-editor">
  Switching to Helix Editor
  <a href="#switching-to-helix-editor">#</a>
</h2>
<p>During the setup, I decided to ditch my bloated Neovim configuration which I&rsquo;ve kept adding on and on to and it was becoming ugly.</p>
<p>I wanted something that has everything built-in, is lightweight, fast, and made with Rust.</p>
<p>So I decided to use Helix editor instead, because i just grew tired of having to manage my LSPs with Neovim. Helix is awesome at what it does, and I was mostly happy with it.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="hard-times">
  Hard Times
  <a href="#hard-times">#</a>
</h3>
<p>But I was about to switch back, because the only thing Helix is missing is a way to properly navigate files. However, while looking at the pull requests for Helix I noticed that it has a <a href="https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/pull/11285">pull request</a> which adds a basic file navigator that really covers all my needs.</p>
<p>So I was excited. I cloned, checked out and built it. But it was painful. Helix binary wasn&rsquo;t aware of the runtime directory that it usually knows about, which contains tools for syntax highlighting (treesitter) and it didn&rsquo;t recognize my configuration either. There were a few other pull requests I really wanted to use, but it started feeling like it was too much pain.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="discovering-the-power-of-flakes">
  Discovering the Power of Flakes
  <a href="#discovering-the-power-of-flakes">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Then I saw that they have a flake.nix file, so I researched flakes. I previously didn&rsquo;t want to use flakes because I didn&rsquo;t see the point, I have all my packages from nixpkgs. Why should I use them?</p>
<p>But, as it turns out &ndash; flakes make the process I described above <em>comically easy</em>. I converted my setup to flakes, and then I pointed one of the inputs at the helix repository. And it built from <code>master</code>. I was astonished, because I could see the potential that this can have&hellip;</p>
<p>I cloned helix repo, added the pull requests I wanted merged <em>now</em> rather having to wait a few months for the next release. Merged them into my own repo, then pointed my helix input at my own helix fork on my personal branch rather than helix/main. Holy crap! It successfully built the whole thing, and now I have a file browser. It took like 2 minutes.</p>
<p>Doing this kind of thing on any other linux distribution would be far more painful. I made a post here one week ago saying that I think Nix is the best distribution, but now I think that 10x.</p>
<p>I was changed as a person and I&rsquo;ll never be the same again.</p>
