    <p>In December of 2023 I wanted to learn Web development, for fun. I was 6 months away from my A-Level exams and I was really bored.</p>
<p>I found this website called <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a>, which is a free and open-source curriculum for learning web development. Perfect!</p>

  Forced into Linux
  <a href="#forced-into-linux">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, one of the requirements for the course was to use Linux. Odin Project didn&rsquo;t support Windows, only Mac and Linux at the time. I didn&rsquo;t have a Mac, so&hellip;</p>
<p>It was an all-or-nothing situation. Either I use Linux, or I can&rsquo;t complete this course. Mind you, I had absolutely zero idea what a Linux was. I&rsquo;ve only ever been using Windows before.</p>
<p>But despite that fact, my curiosity got the best of me and I decided to try it out.</p>
<p>Having zero idea that it will change my life, I followed their installation instructions for Ubuntu. It took me an entire day to install it, but I finally did.</p>
<h2 class="heading" id="descent-into-madness">
  Descent into Madness
  <a href="#descent-into-madness">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Once I did, I opened the file manager and was terrified &ndash; I had no idea what was going on. Where are all the Program Files? Why is everything empty?</p>
<p>Initially I thought that on Linux you can&rsquo;t access any of the &ldquo;system files&rdquo;. I thought to myself, hey &ndash; I&rsquo;ll just complete this course and then go back to my familiar Windows.</p>
<p>The Odin Project also had several lessons on the command line, such as creating new files, changing directories, etc. The basics.</p>
<p>It was extremely confusing to me, because I had no idea what was happening. But it was also super interesting and I wanted to learn more.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="researching-commands">
  Researching Commands
  <a href="#researching-commands">#</a>
</h3>
<p>I spent several days researching various Linux commands. Odin Project said that Linux is used everywhere in development, that&rsquo;s why I continued to go through with it.</p>
<p>But to be honest, I didn&rsquo;t really see a point in it. I thought that typing out all of these commands is a waste of time. That was just in the beginning.</p>
<p>As I continued to use Linux full-time as my computer for several weeks, I slowly became more accustomed to it. I found myself more efficient in the command line than with their file explorer.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="becoming-more-efficient">
  Becoming more Efficient
  <a href="#becoming-more-efficient">#</a>
</h3>
<p>And it all started from there. I found out that I can make aliases in bash, so I aliased <code>e</code> to <code>ls</code>, and <code>t</code> to <code>cd</code> and then <code>ls</code> in the new directory.</p>
<p>Worked like a charm, it was very much an improvement in efficiency. I found myself always using <code>ls</code> when <code>cd</code> so might as well combine them.</p>
<p>I started tinkering with my system more and more over time, learning about various configuration options and programs like <code>cat</code>.</p>
<p>At some point I needed to create a bunch of files with a number at the end, for example like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span style="display:flex;"><span>touch file1 file2 file3 file4 file5 ... file67
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Typing out the above is actually so much faster than if I were to use a GUI like a file manager to do the same thing.</p>
<p>But better yet, I dicovered there was a way to do that much more concisely:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span style="display:flex;"><span>touch file{1..67}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>And oh wow. That just worked. It worked like a charm. I saved so much time from this. And from there on, I started learning more about Unix commands.</p>
<p>I learned how to use <code>grep</code> to search for strings fast, and <code>find</code> to dig through the filesystem in order to find a file matching a pattern, which turned out <em>very</em> useful for adjusting to unfamiliar codebases.</p>
