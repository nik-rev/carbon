    <p>I&rsquo;ve been using VSCode for several months when I first started programming. It was fine, but I was tired of using like 40 plugins and not using any of them to their capabilities.</p>
<p>At the end of the day it felt like I had no control over my editor and I didn&rsquo;t have an idea of how things were going on. Because I didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been hearing about Neovim for a while until this point decided to give it a try. I expected it to be difficult to get started, because it&rsquo;s a mouseless modal editor &ndash; a completely new way of editing code than what I&rsquo;ve been used to.</p>
<p>But honestly, it was way easier to get started than I originally anticipated. It took me about 1 day to learn the basic vim motions. I&rsquo;ve learned to edit text and navigate around files pretty well in just a couple days. But I still couldn&rsquo;t switch away from VSCode since I wanted intellisense, goto definition and other fancy IDE functionality.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Neovim supported all of those. But actually getting any of it setup was immense pain. It took me about 2 weeks of wrestling and tinkering with my neovim config to finally get a setup that felt right.</p>
<p>There was quite a lot of bloat in my config, a lot of &ldquo;eye candy&rdquo; that I ended up getting rid of. For example <a href="https://github.com/folke/noice.nvim">noice.nvim</a> which becomes distracting after a while.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Neovim for several months by this point and things were starting to settle. But every week or so I had to spend <strong>several hours</strong> fixing my configs because a new error arose due to one of my 60+ plugins updating.</p>
<p>Sometimes you just want to open your text editor and use it to write code. But when you have bugs you need to fix and sift through dozens of github issues.</p>
<p>I loved Neovim a lot as well as the mouse-less terminal lifestyle I&rsquo;ve gotten used to, thanks to Neovim. But the amount of time I spent on my editor vs actually using it to write code was just insane. So I was just thinking of switching back to VSCode and using vim motions plugin, since I just wanted to become productive again.</p>
<p>Yes, Neovim made me write code <em>way faster</em>, but at what cost? I have to seriously maintain my configuration as if it was some kind of projects. Think of breaking changes when updating my dependencies. Maybe even should add automated tests?</p>
<p>So I stumbled upon Helix, which is a terminal modal editor written in Rust. I decided to give it a try, and I was <em>seriously impressed</em>. Not only did it do literally everything I want Neovim to be out of the box with ZERO configuration, its editing model was also signifincalty more intuitive than Neovim&rsquo;s. I also found myself way more productive with Helix due to Helix&rsquo;s multiple cursor feature.</p>
<p>I went full-helix for around a week to properly test-drive it and consider switching full time. That was a really easy choice. The community is really nice, but most importantly, I just love how clean Helix&rsquo;s Rust codebase is. It&rsquo;s so incredibly hackable, if Helix does not have a feature, I just write a bit of code and send a pull request. Until it&rsquo;s merged, I just use it in my personal fork. I&rsquo;ve made a couple of such pull requests:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/pull/12299">Colors for items in the completion menu #12299</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/pull/12308">Color swatches ( üü© green üü• #ffaaaa ) #12308</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3ANikitaRevenco+is%3Aclosed+is%3Amerged">More can be seen here</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The only thing Helix was really missing is an ability to navigate across the file system. Stuff like delete folders, rename files etc. But there was a pull request which I&rsquo;ve merged into my own personal fork <a href="https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/pull/11164">Command expansion v2 #11164</a> which provided the full functionality I&rsquo;d want.</p>
<p>Now I really don&rsquo;t see a reason why I would ever switch back to Neovim or something like VSCode. Helix is blazingly fast, meets all my demands, extremely hackable and reliable. I don&rsquo;t need to worry about one of my 60 plugins pushing a breaking change and force me to investigate for half an hour instead of actually writing my code.</p>
<p>Helix to Neovim feels like what Neovim is to Vim. Really, I am super impressed that this piece of software was written in just 4 years. Really excited for the future of Helix.</p>
