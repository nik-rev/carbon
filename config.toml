I'm Nik, I am a fully self taught developer who started programming at 17 and fell in love with it ever since.

In my free time I contribute to open source projects such as the [Helix Editor](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix) as a hobby. Here are some of my most proud pull requests:
- Adding file operations to the file explorer such as delete files, rename files -- [#12902](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/pull/12902)
- Implemented a Language Server Protocol feature that shows you colored boxes next to colors in the file, such as in CSS -- [#12308](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/pull/12308)
- [*and a bunch more...*](https://github.com/search?q=author%3Anik-rev&type=pullrequests)

I started with web development in TypeScript and React, it was fun but I realised that I am most interested in low-level performance optimizations, compilers, etc.

My favorite language is Rust, of course :), it's the language that makes me feel really confident that my code isn't going to explode once its in production.

I like monads. And NixOS!
